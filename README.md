<h1>Project: Automated Metadata Management and Medical Insurance Cost Analysis with Predictive Modeling</h1>

<h2>Business Problem:</h2> Medical insurance companies need to accurately predict the cost of claims to better manage risk and set premiums. The current manual and fragmented data management processes make it difficult to obtain accurate and timely predictions. There is a need for an automated system to manage data, ensure its accuracy, and provide robust cost predictions.
<h2>Aim of the Project:</h2> Create a system that automatically manages and analyzes data for predicting medical insurance costs. The goal is to improve the accuracy of these predictions using advanced statistical methods and machine learning. The system will also provide easy-to-understand explanations of the predictions with Generative AI, making the process more transparent and efficient for insurance companies.
<h2>Business Solution:</h2> Create a system that automates the handling of data and checks its quality. This system will use advanced statistical methods and machine learning to predict medical costs based on factors like age, BMI, and smoking status. It will also use Generative AI to provide easy-to-understand explanations of the predictions, making the whole process more transparent and reliable.
